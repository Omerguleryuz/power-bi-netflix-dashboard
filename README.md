## Netflix Power BI Dashboard

I have prepared an interactive Power BI dashboard using the Netflix dataset provided on Kaggle. The dashboard visualizes some of Netflix's main metrics, such as the number of movies, TV shows, content, directors and rating distributions, country and director rankings, country performances by year, etc.

I have improved my skills in DAX, data modeling and interactive visualizations.
